                    <p class="mb-4">We demonstrate the use of the AIO with the use of a blockchain protocol, modeled with the AIO, geared towards peer-to-peer data sharing in the field of biomedical research. Studies show it can take up to seventeen years for research to go from bench (basic research) to bedside (clinical applications). This could be mitigated by extending datasets to their full potential. Often, Biomedical datasets have multiple implications, yet researchers only use them for their intended use. Thus, other researchers could greatly reduce the time from bench to bedside by reducing the data collection period and reusing existing data. An application of economic game theory allows us to derive a use case we have coined the “Young Investigator’s Dilemma,” taking inspiration from the infamous Prisoner’s Dilemma.</p>
                    
                    <h1 class="h3 mb-2 text-gray-800">User Story</h1>
                    <p class="mb-4">In our proposed game we have two participants, a young investigator, and a data seeker. The young investigator, Steven Hep, could be described as a young, new researcher seeking to build their reputation. He has a large number of citations to a small number of publications. His most recent work includes a well-cultivated dataset representing the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) profiles of individuals with lung cancer, which he understands would be coveted in the biomedical community, because of rising, novel work regarding personalized gene therapy treatments utilizing SNP profiles. With the proper incentive, such as a citation, recognition, and reputability, Steven would be willing to share the dataset. The data seeker, who we will refer to as Jeff Wen, is an established researcher seeking to surpass the data creation stage in his next project. We do not know if Jeff means to comply with any policy surrounding the transaction. Displayed below are the actions both participants could take. Steven has the option to share the dataset or to not share the dataset, while Jeff can participate dishonestly (violate data use policies) or participate honestly.</p>

He is concerned by Steven's low SCIENCE-index, but he is able to see that it is because of his low number of publications. His concerns are mitigated by Steven's peer review score, which include several rave reviews of his other datasets and his profile shows four other citations to the SNP dataset. Thus, he requests the SNP dataset. Steven, seeing Jeff's intended use in his data request, is concerned that Jeff will not give his data proper recognition. Understanding that Jeff will be penalized if he does so, Steven approves the request and shares the dataset with Jeff. Jeff has some questions upon attempting to use the data, while also finding the data to be incomplete. He is unable to contact Steven as he is overloaded with other work. Jeff, eventually publishes upon the dataset, citing the data in his work to avoid penalty. This is confirmed by the protocol, rewarding Steven for his contribution. However, the lack of communication and issues with the dataset is documented by the peer review system as Jeff brings up several concerns in his review of the young investigator.</p>
