                    <p class="mb-4">We demonstrate the use of the AIO with the use of a decentralized application,
                        built with our AIO-driven smart contracts, geared towards peer-to-peer data
                        sharing in the field of biomedical research. Studies show it can take up to seventeen years for research to go from the bench (basic research) to bedside (clinical
                        applications). This could be mitigated by extending datasets to their full
                        potential. Often, Biomedical datasets have multiple implications, yet researchers</p>

                    <h1 class="h3 mb-2 text-gray-800">Smart Contract-managed Distributed Knowledge Graphs</h1>
                    <p class="mb-4">With distributed systems continually showing their advantages over centralized
                        protocols, we present a use case for the AIO to build a fully decentralized knowledge graph managed by smart contracts. The IPFS network gives us a great
                        solution for data storage. Specifically utilizing JSON Linked Data (JSON-LD),
                        a system for linking data similar to RDF in JSON file format, to create AIO
                        ontology instances. JSON-LD is lightweight solution that would allow us to store
                        knowledge graphs in fragmented JSON files. However, instead of storing these
                        instances of the AIO in a centralized manner, we can store them utilizing IPFS. Below a sequence diagram displays the process between the layers of the application of a researcher joining the protocol.</p>
                    
                        <p style="text-align:center;"><img src= "img/dkg-sequence.png" style="width:70%; height:80%"></p>
                        <p class="mb-4">We utilize IPNS as a naming system to add mutability to immutable IPFS hashes.
                            Each JSON-LD file would contain the aio attributes and the respective IPNS hashes they point to. We can
                            then from any instance in IPNS, traverse the graph by following the contained
                            IPNS hashes. We further our decentralization by utilizing smart contracts to
                            manage events and activites in the AIO in order to build and modify the graph.
                            Our current design flow utilizes smart contracts to manage the entities within
                            the knowledge graph. For example, when a researcher joins the protocol, our
                            application reaches out to the smart contract to get any necessary IPNS hashes
                            to be included in their JSON-LD file, builds the file, and publishes this file to
                            IPNS. A smart contract interaction then adds their IPNS hash to a mapping
                            within the smart contract. We can then search and traverse, by looking up an
                            IPNS hash stored within the smart contract, following then hash to the JSONLD file, and traverse in any direction necessary by continuing to follow the IPNS
                            hashes. Given below is a snapshot of a sample IPNS instance resolved through an IPFS gateway</p>

                    <p class="mb-4">In our proposed game we have two participants, a young investigator, and a data seeker. The young investigator, Steven Hep, could be described as a young, new researcher seeking to build their reputation. He has a large number of citations to a small number of publications. His most recent work includes a well-cultivated dataset representing the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) profiles of individuals with lung cancer, which he understands would be coveted in the biomedical community, because of rising, novel work regarding personalized gene therapy treatments utilizing SNP profiles. With the proper incentive, such as a citation, recognition, and reputability, Steven would be willing to share the dataset. The data seeker, who we will refer to as Jeff Wen, is an established researcher seeking to surpass the data creation stage in his next project. We do not know if Jeff means to comply with any policy surrounding the transaction. Displayed below are the actions both participants could take. Steven has the option to share the dataset or to not share the dataset, while Jeff can participate dishonestly (violate data use policies) or participate honestly.</p>

He is concerned by Steven's low SCIENCE-index, but he is able to see that it is because of his low number of publications. His concerns are mitigated by Steven's peer review score, which include several rave reviews of his other datasets and his profile shows four other citations to the SNP dataset. Thus, he requests the SNP dataset. Steven, seeing Jeff's intended use in his data request, is concerned that Jeff will not give his data proper recognition. Understanding that Jeff will be penalized if he does so, Steven approves the request and shares the dataset with Jeff. Jeff has some questions upon attempting to use the data, while also finding the data to be incomplete. He is unable to contact Steven as he is overloaded with other work. Jeff, eventually publishes upon the dataset, citing the data in his work to avoid penalty. This is confirmed by the protocol, rewarding Steven for his contribution. However, the lack of communication and issues with the dataset is documented by the peer review system as Jeff brings up several concerns in his review of the young investigator.</p>
