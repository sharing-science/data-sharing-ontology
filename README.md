## Sharing Science Ontology: A Model for Incentivized Data Sharing

# Abstract
In fields such as medical research, data collection is slow
and rigorous, meaning conclusive findings take years to produce. Due
to the closed nature of biomedical research, this leads to the reproduc-
tion of similar datasets, while leaving datasets with multiple implications
abeyant. Further, there is a lack of complete and useful open datasets
in many different fields, which leave researchers with no choice but to
collect data on their own. There is a rising need for a secure data sharing
ecosystem which recommends, incentivizes, and rewards collaborative ef-
forts between researchers and research groups.
Permissionless, public blockchains provide the necessary framework for
trustless and fair data sharing. We design an ontology to capture the
events associated with blockchain-based data sharing and a correspond-
ing incentive scheme, which includes a reputation-based peer review sys-
tem and an index to provide recommendations and ratings of possible
collaborators. We present a use case indicating the ontologyâ€™s plausibil-
ity in the biomedical research community and evaluate our ontology with
a set of competency questions geared towards participating researchers
and other academic stakeholders. Through the use of the ontology, a
blockchain ecosystem can be built that will incentivize, encourage, and
reward data sharing.
